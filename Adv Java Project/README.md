# Write a program using JCF (single java file based project with java file name as linlist) to achieve the following:

### Write a program that randomly stores 10 integer numbers (to start with) in a LinkedList object. Using this LinkedList object, implement stack and queue operations using GUI as follows: Add 2 Radio Buttons for choosing options (a) Stack and (b) Queue, and 4 JButtons (Push, Pop for Stack, and Add, Delete for Queue).

Once you run the program, it should display a LinkedList of 10 random integers in a text field. You should then be able to choose a radio button of either Stack or Queue, followed by one of its operations (Push or Pop Buttons for Stack ONLY, and Add or Delete Buttons for Queue ONLY (Invalid choices like choosing Stack followed by pressing ADD button should not work). The program should then display the modified list ( as per the operation undertaken) in the text field.

Note: In case you think you may not be able to implement the GUI, then use JOptionPane to enter your commands (as shown below), and show the resultant Linked List in the console. The commands to be entered in showInputDialogue will be as follows:

Push

Pop

Add

Delete

Note that Stack is a LIFO (Last in first out) structure, and Queue is a FIFO (First in first out) structure.

The maximum points (for all correct output) that you may get if you do not implement the GUI and choose to use JOptionPane instead is 6 points out of the total of 10 points.

Also, above your code, mention in 2-3 lines of comments, what exactly you have achieved, in case you could not complete the desired output, and whether you used GUI or chose to use JOptionPane.
